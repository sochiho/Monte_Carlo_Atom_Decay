# Monte Carlo simulation for Atom Decay

A script which uses analytical, ODE and Monte-carlo methods to simulate the progression of a collection of atoms through part of their radiactive decay chain. Ra^225 >> AC^225 >> FR^221

Half life of Ra^225 (days): 20.8 
Half life of AC^225 (days): 10.0
Initial number of Ra^225 atos: 250
End time for simulation (days): 100
Number of timepoints to solve to: 50
